## When to Create a Skill

Create a skill when:

- A pattern is used repeatedly and AI needs guidance
- Project-specific conventions differ from generic best practices
- Complex workflows need step-by-step instructions
- Decision trees help AI choose the right approach

**Don't create a skill when:**

- Documentation already exists (create a reference instead)
- Pattern is trivial or self-explanatory
- It's a one-off task

---

## Skill Structure

```

├── SKILL.md              # Required - main skill file
├── assets/               # Optional - templates, schemas, examples
│   ├── template.py
│   └── schema.json
└── references/           # Optional - links to local docs
    └── docs.md           # Points to docs/developer-guide/*.mdx

## Critical Patterns

{The most important rules - what AI MUST know}

## Code Examples

{Minimal, focused examples}

## Commands

```bash
{Common commands}
```

- **Documentation**: See [references/](references/) for local docs

## Naming Conventions

| Type | Pattern | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| Generic skill | `{technology}` | `pytest`, `playwright`, `typescript` |
| Project-specific | `{project}-{component}` | `myapp-api`, `myapp-ui` |
| Testing skill | `test-{component}` | `test-api`, `test-ui` |
| Workflow skill | `{action}-{target}` | `skill-creator`, `jira-task` |

---

## Decision: assets/ vs references/

```

Need code templates? → assets/
Need JSON schemas? → assets/
Need example configs? → assets/
Link to existing docs? → references/
Link to external guides? → references/ (with local path)

```

**Key Rule**: `references/` should point to LOCAL files, not web URLs.

---

## Decision: Project-Specific vs Generic

```

Patterns apply to ANY project? → Generic skill (e.g., pytest, typescript)
Patterns are project-specific? → {project}-{name} skill
Generic skill needs project info? → Add references/ pointing to project docs

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Skill identifier (lowercase, hyphens) |
| `description` | Yes | What + Trigger in one block |
| `license` | Yes | Always `Apache-2.0` |
| `metadata.author` | Yes | Your name or organization |
| `metadata.version` | Yes | Semantic version as string |
| `metadata.scope` | Yes | Array of scopes this applies to |
| `metadata.auto_invoke` | Yes | String or array of trigger descriptions |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Array of tools AI can use with this skill |

### allowed-tools

Constrains which tools AI can use when the skill is active:

```yaml
# Read-only skill (analysis)
allowed-tools: [Read, Glob, Grep]

# Full editing skill
allowed-tools: [Read, Edit, Write, Bash]

# Research skill
allowed-tools: [Read, WebSearch, WebFetch]
````

**Valid tools**: `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Bash`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `Task`

## Content Guidelines

### DO

- Start with the most critical patterns
- Use tables for decision trees
- Keep code examples minimal and focused
- Include Commands section with copy-paste commands

### DON'T

- Add Keywords section (agent searches frontmatter, not body)
- Duplicate content from existing docs (reference instead)
- Include lengthy explanations (link to docs)
- Add troubleshooting sections (keep focused)
- Use web URLs in references (use local paths)

---

## Registering the Skill

After creating the skill, run sync.sh to auto-populate AGENTS.md:

```bash
./skills/ops/skill-sync/assets/sync.sh
```

The skill will be added to the appropriate AGENTS.md file based on its scope.

## Checklist Before Creating

- [ ] Skill doesn't already exist (check `skills/`)
- [ ] Pattern is reusable (not one-off)
- [ ] Name follows conventions

- [ ] Critical patterns are clear
- [ ] Code examples are minimal
- [ ] Commands section exists
- [ ] `metadata.scope` lists applicable scopes
- [ ] `metadata.auto_invoke` describes the trigger
